# Cxn Cli to create vue-template

This is a command line tool for the [Create Vue-template cli](https://github.com/xn213/vue-template).
Cxn requires tools such as babel, which are plugin-based and require a
significant amount of work to configure properly.

Cxn CLI helps you quickly create a new Vue project that contains the basic file structure
as well as all of the required tools and configuration code for using the framework.

## Usage

Install the `cxn-cli` tool:

```
npm install cxn-cli --global
```

### For a completely new project

To create a new scaffold project inside the current directory and start it, enter:

```
xn init vue-template my-vue
cd my-vue
npm i
npm run serve
```

>>>>>>> own cli use git@github.com:xn213/vue-template
